# Pets for adoption gallery

# Description

This is a basic website that displays a title, a row of cards, and a footer. I have used the JavaScript library React to create components for the header, cards, badge, and footer. The card components are designed to be reusable throughout the entire project, with props used to pass in the content.

To simplify the layout process, I have utilized the React-Bootstrap library, which provides pre-built components such as the cards.

This website was created as a challenge for the bootcamp DesafíoLatam.
